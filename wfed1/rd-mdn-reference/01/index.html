					<p class="border">HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the basis for any website or web application.  It is how the content is structured and displayed.  While HTML defines content, other languages like CSS and JavaScript handle the presentation and behavior of the content.  HyperText and links are used to link different web pages together.  HTML markup involves annotating text, images, and other content using elements enclosed within tags.  Elements like (head, body, header,) and more are essential for structuring content.  The importance of semantic elements like (article, section, nav,) and others is emphasized for conveying the meaning and stucture of content effectively.  All elements need to be wrapped in &lt; and &gt;.  Overall the source gives a comprehensive introduction to HTML, covering basic concepts, tutorials, advanced topics, and other resources. It's a valuable resource for anyone wanting to learn web development.</p>

				<h2><a class="link2" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN CSS</a></h2>
					<p class="border">Cascading Style Sheets or (CSS) is code that gives a website its styling and design.  CSS is made up of two parts: the selector and  declaration.  The selector is an HTML element name at the start of the rule set.  It defines the element to be styles on the website.  The declaration contains the property and the property value.  The property declaration the type of style you want to add to the element and the property value is a choice you make of what kind of style you want the property to make (there are multiple choices for each property).<span>An example is: body{color: red;}</span>
					Each selector can have, and most often does, have multiple declarations.  In CSS you can group multiple elements together in one selector.<span>For Example: section, article, p{background: black;}</span>
					There are five types of selectors.  Element selector, ID selector, class selector, attribute selector, and psuedo-class selectors.  The ID selector is unique and can only be used once on a page while the class selector can be used multiple times on each page.  The ID and class selectors have unique names and are attached to HTML to style a specific area of the page.  CSS is what makes each website unique in its own way and allows developers to show their creativity in designing a website.  The MDN Web Docs source is a fantastic source of information to learn new skills!  It is easy to navigate and has a ton of information about different styling methods.  I used to use W3Schools a lot but may start transitioning to this source instead.

                <h2>Summary of Content</h2>
                	<p class="border">I really like the content on this website.  It is very easy to navigate to what you are looking for.  There are many links that take you to different pages and explain the different features of HTML and CSS.  It does a great job of explaining what each element is in HTML as well as selectors in CSS.  It shows examples of sturcture and how to code your css pages and explains what each selector is in depth.  This is a great resource to have for anyone that is just starting out or a coding veteran that may have a question about how something works.  I will definetly be using this tool!
