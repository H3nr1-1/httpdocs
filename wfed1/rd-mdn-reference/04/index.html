                <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications.   It provides a variety of components like navigation menus.  Bootstrap's documentation includes examples, code snippets, and customization options for implementing hamburger menus, collapsible navigation bars, and other mobile-friendly navigation's.  Navigation that can be used are components like "pills", "tabs", "drop downs", and "pills with drop downs".  All components can be used with hamburger menus on mobile devices.  Bootstrap is easy to use with no extra CSS or JavaScript.  You need to either download the Bootstrap code or link to the Bootstrap CDN in the head section.  Then its pretty much just plug and play.  Bootstrap is easy to use and gives a great navigation look to web site and applications.</p>

                <p>Holly Sunderland, published an article on a website called Medium about a gaming website called GAMINGbible and how they changed their website and worked away from hamburger menus and went with a totally different approach.  As you scroll their website, each important section, that would be like a new page, would have a new "sticky tab".  The further you scroll the sticky tabs keep stacking up the side of your screen.  If you want to quickly go back to a certain section, you can click that sections sticky tab.  This unique change introduces a fresh new approach for users.  I think this is a fun idea for gamers.</p>

                <a class="link" href="https://dovetail.com/ux/hamburger-menu/">Hamburger Menu Design 101</a>
                <p>A very interesting article by Jean Kaluza on Dovetail.com called Hamburger Menu Design 101.  The article talks about how effective hamburger menus are in user experience design.  It talks about the importance of context and content organization when using hamburger menus,  prioritizing the need to balance minimalism with accessibility.  Basically keeping the hamburger small enough, yet big enough to be able to make it accessible for everyone.  By studying real-world examples and case studies, the article provides information for designing mobile navigation.  Designers can gain insight from the analysis of successful implementations and learn how to optimize hamburger menus for improved usability and user experience.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>There are a ton on resources on the internet about how to create navigation menus for website and for mobile devices.  Hamburger navigation's are a great resource and widely used, but like in the second source above, there are some unique alternatives that some websites are changing to.  Everything is driven off of the user experience and how the user responds to the changes.  Even with these fun, unique, new designs to navigation, the research I have done still points to the hamburger navigation being king.  Its simple, compact, and organized.</p>
