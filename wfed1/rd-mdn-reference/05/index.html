                <h4>Novalidate, Method, and Action:</h4>
                <p>In HTML Forms, the 'action' attribute defines the action that is going to be performed when the form is submitted.  There are two different types of methods that are used to submit the information from the form data.  Those methods are "get" and "post".  "Post" is a more secure method of sending information, "get" is used for non-secure data.  The 'novalidate' attribute is a boolean attribute.  When it is added  to the code it specifies that the form data should not be validated when submitted.</p>

                <h2>Form Elements</h2>
                <h4>Fieldset and Legend:</h4>
                <p>The 'fieldset' tag is used to group related form elements in a form.  The 'fieldset' tag also draws a box around the related element.  The 'legend' tag is used to define a caption for the 'fieldset' element.</p>

                <h4>Label and How to Use Attributes: for and id:</h4>
                <p>The 'label' tag is used to define a 'label' for elements.  The for attribute of the 'label' tag needs be the same as the id attribute of the related element to link them together.  A 'label' can also be linked to an element by putting the element inside the 'label' element.</p>

                <h2>Summary of Documentation</h2>
                <p>HTML forms us the 'action' attribute to determine what happens when they're submitted.  You can submit data using two methods: "get" and "post", with "post" being more secure.  Adding 'novalidate' tells the browser not to validate form data.  'Fieldset' groups related elements, visually separated by a box, and 'legend' provides a caption.  'Label' tags describe form elements, linking to them using the 'for' attribute.</p>
