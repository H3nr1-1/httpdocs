                            <p>I choose Bino Kochumol Varghese because he is a developer that uses Bootstrap.  I learned Bootstrap and really enjoy working with it.  It is a GREAT tool for making responsive websites without having to write a ton of media queries.  Bino is from India and is a Software Developer with over 10 years of experience.  He is also a writer and has many blog entries on his website about Web Development.</p><br>
                            <p>He uses a Dell Latitude laptop for writing code and his favorite text editor is VS Code.  He is skilled developer and lists Frontend, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Backend, Markdown, and SQL as the technologies as to what he is skilled in.  He uses Netlify for static web project hosting and Git for version control.  He also uses Canva to create designs for websites and apps.</p>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>I chose Erik Hedin because he is a React developer.  React is a framework I have been interested in learning for a while now.  It seems like every job posting I look at requires React.  Erik works from home and uses a company supplied Mac laptop for work.  He also has a custom build pc that dual boots Linux and Windows 10.</p><br>
                            <p>Erik attended college in Maui, Hawaii.  His passions are Photography, Web Development, mountain biking, cross fit, running, sailing, paddling, and spending time with his family.</p><br>
                            He lists that he is a full-stack web developer, coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  He also works a lot in WordPress and Drupal to develop website.  On top of those he uses Gatsby and of course as I mentioned earlier, React.  His favorite code editor to use is VS Code and he likes to build his Drupal and Wordpress projects in a DDEV shell along with Docker.

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>I clicked through a few profiles and came across and I choose David Perkins because I thought it was unique, creative, and has a ton of information.  He goes into detail about all the equipment he uses and where he got it, along with some really nice photos of his at home desktop space.  He gets very detailed from his monitor and key boards right down to the coffee maker and his favorite coffee!</p><br>
                            <p>In his "about" page, he talks about taking pride in how he is able to work closely with clients and collaborate to make the perfect website for them.  He has been a developer for over 10 years and goes on to list the what he all provides clients in a web development role.  He also shares some of his top choices of projects that he has created for clients.</p><br>
                            <p>David explains that over the 10 years of being a developer he has tried many different text editor software, but nothing beats VS Code.  He gives us some info on the fonts and themes he likes to use.  He also likes to use Laravel Valet for his dev environment.  He uses iTerm for his terminal and Oh my zsh for the shell.  To communicate with clients and collaborators he uses Slack and Discord.  I have personally used Slack as it is the communication tool we use at my internship.</p>
