                <h2>What is Serverless Hosting?</h2>
                <p>Serverless web hosting is where all server management and infrastructure is managed by a third party.  The developer would never have to manage their own servers and its cheaper overall.  There are many benefits of serverless hosting like, cost effectiveness.  You only pay for what you use.  Another benefit is that there is no site maintenance.  Deployments are also much quicker as you never need to use an FTP to upload your site.  Simply make a push to GitHub and the website will be automatically deployed.  They also provide security features that automatically scale for high traffic loads.</p><br>

                <h2>Why Use It?</h2>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, the benefits of serverless hosting are: no server management, auto-scaling, pay as you go pricing, faster deploy times, and security.  Serverless hosting is really excels for static web sites.</p><br>

                <h2>Serverless Provider 1 - Netlify</h2>
                <p>Netlify is a GitHub based host for static websites.  It offers easy deployments directly from a GitHub repository.  It is really popular for developers that build sites using React or Vue.</p><br>

                <h2>Serverless Provider 2 - Cloudfare Pages</h2>
                <p>Cloudfare Pages is a fast and secure hosing platform for static websites that uses the Cloudfare global network.  Like Netlify, it uses GitHub or GitLab.  Cloudfare Pages is free to use and ideal for personal websites, documentations, and high performance web apps.</p><br>

                <h2>Summary of Documentation</h2>
                <p>Serverless hosting is a really convenient way to put your website or apps online without worrying about servers or infrastructure. Instead of setting up and managing a server yourself, you just focus on your code, and platforms like Netlify and Cloudflare Pages handle the rest like: scaling, performance, and security. It’s perfect for things like personal portfolios, landing pages, or apps built with modern frontend frameworks. Plus, it’s often free (or really affordable), super fast thanks to global CDNs, and easy to deploy straight from GitHub.  Serverless hosting makes it much easier to launch and maintain websites without the tech headache.</p>
