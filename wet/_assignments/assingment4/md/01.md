## Summary of Michelle Barker Blogs

*   [Blog - CSS Masonry Layout Syntax](https://css-irl.info/css-masonry-layout-syntax/)

Why her blog doesn't tell us exactly how to make a CSS masonry layout it does talk about some of the difficulties behind the once popular design. She does give links to other blogs of people she follows that could give more direction on how to design a masonry layout but in her blog she talks about the challenges that a developer could face. For one, most of the time a developer would need to implement a javascript library to complete a layout.

  

I have always been interested in the masonry layout just because I think it looks cool. Especially for a photo collection. While I have never tried making a layout like this, I have looked into it a little bit. I use the BootStrap framework a lot and I have seen that BootStrap does have a masonry plugin to use to help create a layout like this. I think if I was to ever attempt to implement a masonry layout I would come back to this blog post and take a look at the 3 or 4 other blogs that she points you to in her entry.
