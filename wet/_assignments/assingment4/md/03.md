## What is Serverless Hosting?

Serverless web hosting is where all server management and infrastructure is managed by a third party. The developer would never have to manage their own servers and its cheaper overall. There are many benefits of serverless hosting like, cost effectiveness. You only pay for what you use. Another benefit is that there is no site maintenance. Deployments are also much quicker as you never need to use an FTP to upload your site. Simply make a push to GitHub and the website will be automatically deployed. They also provide security features that automatically scale for high traffic loads.

  

## Why Use It?

As I mentioned earlier, the benefits of serverless hosting are: no server management, auto-scaling, pay as you go pricing, faster deploy times, and security. Serverless hosting is really excels for static web sites.
