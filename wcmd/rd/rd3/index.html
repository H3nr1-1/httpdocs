                <p>The functions, "the_author" and "the_author_link" are very similar in that they will both display a post authors name.  However, "the_author_link" takes it another step, with making the authors name a link to his or her website url.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary of Documentation</h2>
                <p>Author functions are a very useful tool in WordPress and CMS.  It is an easy way to dynamically pull the names of authors from the database and display them for the users to see.  "the_author_link" would be especially helpful if an author has their own URL and a user wants to look them up to research more into their work.</p>
