                <h2>Flexbox Froggy</h2>
                <p>Flexbox Froggy is a fun interactive game to learn flexbox.  Once I started I didn't want to stop.  I think it took me about 45 minutes to complete all 24 levels.  The 24 level was by far the hardest.  The way it is laid out and taught makes it fun to learn.  I really liked the way it explained different concepts at the start of different sections.  It starts with justify-content, then goes to align-items.  After a couple of steps it starts to have the user combine the 2 properties and use them together.  The property I had some problems with at first was the order property.  I had never used it before and I couldn't figure out how to write it.  But once I figured it out it went pretty well.  At the end, the final problem combined 4 properties into 1 situation.  There were 8 properties to pick from.  It was difficult and took me a bit, but after thinking about it, I was able to figure it out and complete the 24 levels!</p>
