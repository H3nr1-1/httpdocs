                  <h3>Who is the target audience?</h3>
                  <p>I designed my showcase web page to be colorful and fun.  I wanted it to be an intriguing design that would catch a persons eye.</p>
                  <h3>What is the message?</h3>
                  <p>The message is simply to call attention to the digital arts showcase and the creativity of the people who will be attending.</p>
                  <h3>What is the goal?</h3>
                  <p>My goal is to display the kind of work I am capable of doing.  I'm normally not a creative person, but want a chance to show off my creative side.</p>
                  <h3>What are the Call to Actions?</h3>
                  <p>My design has animations around all the call to actions.  The cards have some transforms and the buttons use keyframes.  I wanted everything to have some sort of interaction.</p>
                  <h3>Design Summary</h3>
                  <p>My personal preference for website layout is the full page look instead of all the content inside the wrapper, so I went with that design.  I started with a 3D Nav button that has a clicked animation when clicked.  The header is a large full screen image that tells you exactly what the web page is going to be about with a colorful display.  The aside is used next with the information to the event as well as a link to the NWTC website. The cards are responsive with a 2 column grid until a single column mobile view.  The cards have a bunch of moving parts with a full card image, information text box on hover and a button to take you to another page for more information.  Then the footer is a full page width as well.</p>
